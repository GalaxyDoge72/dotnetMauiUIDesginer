## .NET MAUI UI Designer ##

I got sick of having to try to figure out how to work with the .NET MAUI XAML code, so I'm building an app to give a GUI drag and drop similar to the Windows Forms Designer.
Hopefully this will help a lot of people in writing MAUI apps.

Requires .Net 9.0 runtime (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0/runtime)
